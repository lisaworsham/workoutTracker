# workoutTracker

The purpose of this website was to create a Mongo database with a Mongo Schema and handle the routes with Express with the front end code provided.

## Prerequisites

Visual Studio Code was used to build. NodeJS, Express, and Mongoose dependencies were used.

## Process/What was Changed

The front end code and seeders were provided. So I needed to add in the code for the server.js file, and create the models and routes for all the gets/posts for the API and HTML. 

## Review

This was a pretty easy exercise overall. But I struggled with it in the beginning. I lacked proper motivation due to personal issues. But after stepping back and coming back to it, it was a nice refresher in the previous material we had covered. Alot of it was digging through some of the front end and seeing what needed to be done with GETs, POSTs, and PUTs.
